\begin{frame}{Conclusion}
	\vfill
	New method for learning with modality side modality have been presented. BU-TF is more efficient than hallucination as it needs less training time have less parameters while producing comparable results.

	{
		The presented method has to be tested:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item<3-> on over modalities
			\item<4-> with other aggregation scheme
			\item<5-> on other visual localisation tasks (\textit{e.g.} pose regression)
		\end{itemize}
